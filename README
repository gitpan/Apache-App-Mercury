Apache::App::Mercury 0.80 - Internal web server messaging for Apache mod_perl

Apache::App::Mercury is a customizable, extensible customer to customer,
store and forward messaging application for Apache mod_perl (1.x).
It uses a relational database (accessed via DBI) to store and retrieve
messages, and uses CGI.pm to display them in standard HTML.  It's design
closely resembles a MVC design pattern, and it handles all message box
navigation, message composition, sending, replying, etc.  In short, it
is a complete web (intra server) messaging application for your Apache
mod_perl server, which can be customized to fit your specific needs
(e.g. private labelling).

It was originally written to provide a basic, easy-to-use secure messaging
system: if it is run on an SSL-enabled server, and your message database
is on an encrypted filesystem, then it's "pretty secure".
I would call it a good balance between security and ease-of-use, since
all messages are encrypted, but users don't need to manage any digital keys.
The fact that all messages are kept on one server could be viewed either as
a security weakness or strength: if that machine is compromised, the
attacker gets all the messages; on the other hand, you can heavily
secure this one machine, whereas if you use a distributed messaging system
users typically store their messages in plaintext on very insecure boxes.
(ie. Windows)

Note on version: the version is < 1.0 not because it is not ready for
production, but because there is more documentation to be written,
test suites to be written, better installation procedure to be designed, etc.
